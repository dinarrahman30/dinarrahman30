**INTRODUCE MYSELF**

👋 Hi, I’m Dinar Wahyu Rahman

As a final year undergraduate student, I am still working on Python, SQL, and machine learning skills. From my understanding of programming language skills and these skills, I was able to produce several small and medium-scale projects related to data science, and machine learning (Recommender System, NLP, and Computer Vision). I like to learn new things and develop them.


- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence, Big Data, Web Development, Game Development, AR-VR Development, or Metaverse.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Universitas Terbuka (Mathematics).
