**INTRODUCE MY SELF**

👋 Hi, I’m Dinar Wahyu Rahman

I'm just an undergraduate student with an interest in coding and aspire to be a software engineer in the future. Currently I am still in the process of mastering skills in Python and Javascript programming languages, SQL, machine learning and website programming. From the results of learning programming language skills and these skills, I can produce several projects in small and medium scale related to data science, machine learning, and website programming. I personally enjoy learning new things and building on them. I am also a person who is flexible to new environments, has good speaking and writing skills, likes to work with a reliable team, likes to analyze things, and likes challenging assignments.
